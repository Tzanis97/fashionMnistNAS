# Neural Architecture Search on Classification Problem

Implemantation (for personal educational purposes and better understanding of NAS concept) on selecting the optimal architecture of a model that classifies fashion products into 10 categories.

## Dataset

For the purpose of the problem (training and evaluation), the Fashion-MNIST database will be used, containing 70,000 images (28x28 pixels, greyscaled) with corresponding tags from the 10 categories.

## Model Training and Evaluation

In the file `fashionmnistmodel.py`, you can find the code for model training and evaluation.

## Neural Architecture Search Experiment

Execute the experiment on your local server using the `NAS.py` file.

## Note

Values on both training and experiment are specially selected for computational convenience and understanding of the experiment.
